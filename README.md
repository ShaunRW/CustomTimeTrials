# Custom Time Trials
Adds a new time trial racing mode to GTA V. Also includes an editor to create the time trials.

### Requires:

* ScriptHookV
* ScriptHookVdotnet
* NativeUI


### Installation:

Copy the following items into the 'Grand Theft Auto V/scripts' directory.
* CustomTimeTrials.dll file.
* Newtonsoft.json.dll file.
* TimeTrials folder.


### How to use:

* Once in-game, press F9 to access the menu. from here you can select the time trial you wish to start, or if you wish to create your own time trial using the editor.


### Todo:

Planned:
* Add a way to exit out of a time trial whenever.
* Show time of current lap on the hud.
* Show fastest laptime this race on the hud.
* Record Race Results for stats purposes. Such as fasted time on this time trial.
* Add Race Option for police. eg, Disabled, Allowed, Always [1-5] star.

Maybe:
* Add traffic levels to the Traffic option. eg, Off, Light, Moderate, heavy, etc
* Disable missions while racing. Not sure if this is possible.


### Bugs:

* With traffic set to off, a very small number of vehicles still spawn. Might need to remove them on the fly every so many frames.
